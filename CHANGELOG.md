# Changelog

Every release, newest first. One file — the section matching the version being built is compiled
into the exe and shown in **What's new**, so a release no longer needs its own notes file.

**Releasing a new version**

1. Add a `## vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` section at the top of this file.
2. Bump `<Version>` in `src/RobloxAccountManager.csproj` to the same number.
3. Push the tag `vX.Y.Z`. The release workflow builds the exe, publishes its SHA-256 and uses the
   section you just wrote as the release body — the same section the app embeds and shows in
   **What's new**.
4. Run `python tools/check-localization.py` first — the workflow runs it too and stops on a missing
   or broken translation.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Browser sign-in no longer reports "The sign-in window was closed" while the window is open.** The
  sign-in followed the process that was started first, which a Chromium launcher can hand off and
  exit. Whether the window is open now comes from the browser itself over DevTools, and closing the
  browser afterwards goes through DevTools too, so no browser or profile is left behind.
- **Private servers in presets.** A private-server link pasted into a preset's "Server ID" box was
  launched as a Job ID and failed. Presets now have a destination (game, server, private server,
  join player); existing presets are converted on start, including links that were typed into the
  old box.
- **Auto-rejoin returns to the same destination.** A client that crashed in a private server or
  while following a player used to rejoin a public server of the place. A public server that fails
  twice is swapped for any server of the place, and a failed relaunch is retried twice.
- Pasting a game link with a private-server code into a Place ID box no longer turns the code into
  part of the place number.
- Launch errors no longer echo the launch link, which carries a one-time sign-in ticket.

### Added

- **Join player** and **private server** destinations for presets, with the player looked up while
  you type.
- **Ultra-low AFK performance profile** per preset: FPS cap (15 by default), lowest graphics,
  optional minimize after launch. The next launch without it restores your normal settings.
- **Random Anti-AFK timing.** Each client gets its own schedule, optionally random between two
  intervals, so several clients aren't focused at the same second. The overview shows when each
  client gets its next key press and how often it was rejoined.
- **Batch launches wait for each client** before starting the next account, plus an optional random
  extra delay per preset. A failed account doesn't stop the rest; the result reads "5 launched,
  1 failed".
- **Test the browser** under Settings → Browser, **Copy report** under Settings → Diagnostics (with
  cookies, tokens, webhooks and private-server codes removed), and **Minimize** per client.
- Local API: `/launch` takes `link=` or `followUserId=`; new `/preset?name=`.

### Changed

- The memory settings say what they do: the RAM threshold force-closes a client (it is not a memory
  limit), and trimming frees memory only until the client needs it again. Auto-trim runs at most
  every 5 minutes.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-09-17

Rebuilt from the ground up: a new interface, eight languages, and every feature that was still open
on the roadmap.

### A new interface

- **New layout.** A sidebar with your groups, an **Overview** page, and an **Accounts** page with a
  detail panel next to the list. Everything about an account (launching, notes, session, 2FA, proxy,
  FastFlags) is in that panel, in tabs.
- **Light, dark or system theme** with six accent colors. The color editor is still there for
  fine-tuning.
- **Command palette.** Press **Ctrl+K** to jump to any account, page or setting, or run an action.
- **Settings in categories** with a search box, instead of one long page.
- **Eight languages:** English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Português (Brasil), Polski, Türkçe and
  Русский. The app starts in your Windows language; change it under **Settings → General**.
- **Better filtering and sorting.** Filter by online, in game, offline, needs attention or pinned;
  sort by name, status, last used, Robux or playtime; switch between a comfortable and a compact list.
- Keyboard shortcuts throughout: **Ctrl+N** add account, **Ctrl+F** search, **Enter** launch,
  **Space** tick, **F5** refresh, **Ctrl+1–5** switch pages.

### Roadmap features

- **Account health.** The Overview lists sessions that have expired, haven't been checked for two
  weeks or are over a year old, with a one-click check or sign-in. Every account shows its session
  age and when it was last checked.
- **Presets and schedules editor.** The new **Automation** page builds launch presets (accounts,
  place, delay) and schedules (time, days, launch or close, close again after a while) without
  touching a file.
- **Per-account proxy** is now actually used: Roblox web requests and browser windows for that
  account go through it. Each account has its own **Test** button.
- **Light mode**, as a proper theme rather than an edited dark one.

### Signing in

- **Browser sign-in is the default.** Roblox's own login page opens in a clean, temporary profile of
  Edge or Chrome. Captchas, 2-step verification and passkeys work as usual, the password never
  passes through the app, and the profile is deleted right after.
- The **private browser download is optional** now. It is only needed on PCs without Edge or Chrome,
  and every download is checked against the SHA-256 published with it.
- Signing in with username and password and pasting a cookie are still available as tabs.

### Security

- **Lock the manager** with your master password: with **Ctrl+L**, after a period without input, or
  when the window is minimized. Wrong passwords slow down further attempts.
- **Copied secrets clear themselves.** Cookies, API tokens and 2FA codes leave the clipboard after
  30 seconds (adjustable) and are kept out of Windows clipboard history and cloud sync.
- The **proxy password, web API token and Discord webhook** are now stored encrypted.
- **Local web API hardening.** Requests from web pages and from foreign host names are refused,
  `/launch` and `/close` require POST, `/cookie` is off until you allow it, and repeated wrong tokens
  are throttled.
- **Plugins are off by default.** If you already have plugin DLLs installed they stay enabled after
  the update.
- Discord webhooks only accept `discord.com` links, CSV exports can no longer carry spreadsheet
  formulas, and the channel between two running copies of the app only accepts your own Windows user.
- The updater only installs files from GitHub, and a download that fails verification is deleted
  instead of being retried as the same broken file.

### Keeping up with Roblox

- **FastFlags follow Roblox's allowlist.** Since September 2025 Roblox ignores flags that aren't on
  it. Options that stopped working were replaced with ones that still do, and flags Roblox ignores
  are listed instead of silently doing nothing.
- **The FPS cap is written to Roblox's own settings file**, the same value as the in-game frame
  rate option. The old FastFlag unlock no longer works.
- **Friends load through Roblox's current endpoint**, which also fixes missing names.
- A failed status request no longer shows every account as offline for a moment.

### Fixes

- An account's color tag is saved again.
- Closing a client on purpose no longer triggers auto-rejoin.
- Scheduled tasks that launch a preset work again.
- An account whose saved cookie can't be decrypted keeps its encrypted value instead of being
  overwritten with an empty one.
- Cancelling the private browser download no longer crashes the app.
- Hotkeys are blocked while the manager is locked, and **Close all Roblox clients** uses the same
  safe path as the button.

### Good to know before updating

- **Your settings are migrated automatically.** The old file is kept as `settings.json.v0.bak` in the
  data folder.
- The old theme presets become accent colors. Custom colors from 1.x are reset, because the color
  names changed.
- If you used the FPS unlock, its value becomes the new FPS cap.
- Rolling back to 1.7 works (**Settings → Updates → Roll back**), but 1.7 can't read the encrypted
  proxy password, API token and webhook. Enter them again there.
- Scripts using the web API: send `POST` for `/launch` and `/close`, and turn on **Allow reading
  cookies** if a tool needs `/cookie`.

## v1.7.0 — 2026-09-09

### Updating is no longer a leap of faith

The self-updater downloaded a file and copied it straight over the running application. Nothing
checked that the file was the application, and nothing kept the build being replaced. A download
truncated by a dropped connection, a GitHub error page returned instead of the binary, a captive
portal's login page — each of them "succeeded" as far as the transfer was concerned, and each of
them left an app that would not start and no way back short of reinstalling by hand.

- **Downloads are verified before anything is replaced.** The file must begin like a Windows
  executable, match the size GitHub reported, and match the SHA-256 published in the release notes.
  Releases are built by a workflow that computes that checksum from the very binary it uploads.
- **Your previous version is kept.** The build being replaced is moved aside rather than
  overwritten, so **Settings → Updates → Restore previous version** puts it back. A swap that fails
  halfway now undoes itself instead of leaving nothing behind.
- **Interrupted downloads resume.** Losing the connection at 95 % of 56 MB used to mean starting
  over; the transfer now continues from where it stopped and retries by itself up to three times.
- **The progress window says something useful** — transferred, speed and time remaining, rather
  than a bare percentage.
- **The right asset is picked.** The updater took the first `.exe` attached to a release, so any
  second executable added later would silently have become what everyone downloads. It now matches
  on the asset name.

### You decide when the app looks for updates

There were no update settings at all: the check ran every five minutes, forever, and the only way
to influence it was not to run the app. **Settings → Updates** is new.

- **Check automatically** on or off, with your own **interval** (default: hourly instead of every
  five minutes) and an independent **check at startup**.
- **Skip this version** — on the update prompt, on the title-bar pill's right-click menu, or from
  Settings. The release stops being offered; the one after it still is. Turning update checks off
  entirely was previously the only way to stop being asked.
- **Include pre-releases**, for anyone who wants test builds before they are final.
- The background check now uses conditional requests, so a poll that finds nothing new costs
  nothing against GitHub's 60-requests-per-hour anonymous budget. When the budget is spent anyway
  the app says so and waits, instead of reporting "you're on the latest version" — which it had no
  way of knowing.

### Start with Windows

A tray application with no way to start with the system. **Settings → Interface → Start with
Windows** adds an entry under your own user account — no administrator rights, no service — and
**Start minimized** opens it straight into the tray. The app is portable, so the entry is re-pointed
at the executable on every start; moving or renaming it no longer leaves a shortcut to nothing.

### Playtime

The app knew exactly when each client started and threw that away when it closed. Sessions are now
recorded per account, so there is an answer to "how much has this account actually played".

- Total and last-7-days playtime on the **account card**, in the **account details**, and on the
  **Dashboard**, plus when each account was last played.
- Stored locally in `data/playtime.json`; six months are kept, sessions under 20 seconds are
  ignored, and clients still running when you close the app are counted rather than lost.
- Off with one switch in **Settings → Live data**, and the history can be cleared there.

### Releases are built by GitHub

Every release was produced on one machine and uploaded by hand — which is also why a checksum was
never published. Pushing a tag now builds the exe on GitHub, fails the build on a single compiler
warning or a tag that disagrees with the project version, takes the release notes from this file,
and attaches the binary together with its `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

---

## v1.6.0 — 2026-08-27

### Sign in with a username and password

Adding an account used to mean pasting a `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie, which means opening browser
developer tools and knowing which value to copy. That single step is where most people got stuck.

**Add account** now opens on a **Sign in** tab: type the Roblox username and password, and the
session cookie is fetched automatically and validated before the account is stored.

- **Two-step verification is handled in the dialog.** When the account has 2FA on, a code field
  appears and says where the code comes from — the authenticator app or the email Roblox just sent.
- **Captchas fall back to a real browser.** Roblox answers some sign-ins with an Arkose puzzle or a
  device confirmation, which nothing but a browser can display. *Sign in in a browser window
  instead* opens the genuine Roblox login page in a throw-away profile, waits for you to finish, and
  picks the session up over the DevTools protocol. The profile is wiped the moment the window closes.
- **Pasting a cookie still works** — it moved to the second tab and is unchanged.

The password is posted to Roblox's own login endpoint and to nothing else. It is never written to
disk, never logged, and never kept once the dialog closes; only the cookie Roblox hands back is
stored, encrypted exactly like every other account.

### Changelog handling

The repository carried one `release_notes_vX.Y.Z.md` per release, and the build embedded whichever
file matched the version. Four releases in, that was four files, and a version bump silently shipped
with no changelog at all if the matching file was missing.

There is now a single `CHANGELOG.md`. The whole file is embedded and the app slices out the section
for the version it is running, so releasing means adding a section and bumping the version — nothing
else. **What's new** gained a **Full changelog** toggle that shows every past version from the same
embedded copy, offline.

### Fixes

- **Cookie validation marked healthy accounts as dead.** The startup check treated *any* failed
  lookup as a rejected cookie, so an HTTP 429 — which validating several accounts at once provokes
  by itself — or simply being offline flagged good accounts invalid and sent people off to re-add
  them. Only an explicit 401/403 from Roblox counts now; anything inconclusive leaves the previous
  state alone.
- **The browser download prompt could open behind the dialog that asked for it**, which was
  indistinguishable from the app freezing, since a modal window blocks input everywhere else.

## v1.5.1

> Coming from **v1.4.0**? This release contains the whole v1.5 line — v1.5.0 was tagged but never
> published, so everything below is new to you.

### Works with Bloxstrap, Froststrap, Fishstrap and friends

The app assumed Roblox always lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\Versions`. On a machine where a
third-party bootstrapper owns the install that folder can be **absent entirely** — the client sits
under the launcher's own directory instead. Three things were wrong as a result:

- the self-check reported **"Roblox is not installed"** on a perfectly working machine
- FastFlags and the FPS cap were written to a folder no client reads, so they did nothing
- even when written to the right version folder, a bootstrapper regenerates that file on every
  launch from its own copy — so the flags were wiped before the client ever saw them

Install discovery now follows the `roblox-player://` protocol handler, which is the authoritative
answer to "what actually starts when we launch", and falls back to every known layout. Flags go to
the launcher's **managed** settings file where one exists, and are **merged** rather than
overwritten, so the flags you set in Bloxstrap/Froststrap yourself survive.

Settings → About now shows which client is installed and who handles launches.

### Fixes

- **"What's new" said "Release notes could not be loaded."** The changelog had exactly one source:
  the GitHub release for the running version. That fails when the release isn't published yet, the
  machine is offline, or the unauthenticated GitHub API limit (60 requests/hour per IP) is spent.
  The notes are now compiled into the exe, so the window always has content; GitHub is a fallback.
- **No way to check for updates on demand.** The background poll runs every 5 minutes but is silent
  when there is nothing new, so "up to date" and "the check is broken" looked identical. Settings →
  About has a **Check for updates** button that always reports an outcome, a line saying when the
  last check ran and what it found, and a **What's new in this version** button to reopen the
  changelog at any time.

### New

- **RAM trimming.** *Trim now* hands every tracked client's idle memory back to Windows, with an
  optional automatic trim on an interval. The status line reports how much was released. Note this
  is not a permanent saving — the pages return when a client touches them again; it helps when
  several clients are open and the machine starts to run short.

---

## v1.5.0

> Tagged but never published as a separate release; everything here also shipped in v1.5.1.

### The engines that were already in there, now reachable

Several complete features shipped in earlier builds but had no way to be switched on: the flags that
enabled them defaulted to off and no page bound to them. The Anti-AFK loop, the crash watchdog, the
RAM monitor, the local control API and the FastFlag writer were all fully implemented, wired up at
startup — and unreachable. Some had never run in any release.

This version gives every one of them a real UI, and fixes the ones that were also broken underneath.

### New

| Feature | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Anti-AFK** | Settings → Automation | Focuses each running client, sends one key tap, returns you to what you were doing. Configurable interval and key, plus *Run one pass now*. |
| **Crash watchdog** | Settings → Automation | Notices when a tracked client closes or crashes. Accounts with the new per-account **Auto-rejoin** switch are relaunched into the same server, with a brake that gives up after 3 crashes in 10 minutes. |
| **RAM monitor** | Settings → Automation | Live per-client memory readout, with an optional cap that closes a client that runs away. |
| **FastFlags** | Settings → FastFlags | Uncap frame rate, disable telemetry, force voxel lighting, disable voice chat, plus a raw JSON editor with live validation. *Write flags now* and *Clear all flags*. |
| **Per-account FastFlags** | Accounts → details | Extra flags applied only when that account launches, merged on top of the global set. |
| **Two-factor codes** | Accounts → details | Paste the Base32 secret Roblox shows under *"Can't scan the QR code?"* and get the live 6-digit code with a rollover countdown and a copy button. Generated locally — nothing leaves the machine. |
| **Global hotkeys** | Settings → Global hotkeys | Record a chord per action (launch, server-hop, close all, focus manager). Click, press, done. |
| **Local control API** | Settings → Local API | Bearer-token HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 for scripting the manager, with token generation, copy, and the endpoint list. |
| **Proxy** | Settings → Proxy | Route the manager's Roblox API traffic through a proxy, with credentials and a *Test proxy* button. |
| **Encrypted backup / restore** | Settings → Security | Portable, password-encrypted export of your accounts (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA256). `accounts.dat` is DPAPI-bound to one Windows user; a backup restores anywhere. Restoring **merges** — existing accounts keep their place and only get a fresh cookie. |
| **More live-data control** | Settings → Live data | Economy tracking toggle and an adjustable presence poll interval. |
| **More security control** | Settings → Security | Startup cookie validation (plus *Check all cookies now*), rotated-cookie capture, and the audit log. |

### Fixes

- **Unlock FPS never did anything.** It wrote `ClientAppSettings.json` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\ClientSettings\` — a path the modern client does not read. The cap was silently ignored on every launch since the feature was added. It now writes into each installed `Versions\<hash>\ClientSettings\`, and merges with your FastFlags instead of the two overwriting each other.
- **The FastFlags engine was never called.** `FFlagsService` existed and worked; nothing in the app invoked it. It now runs on the launch path.
- **Proxy settings were inert.** The address and credentials were saved to disk and read back into the UI, but the HTTP client was built once with no proxy at all, so every Roblox call went out over the direct connection regardless. The proxy is now actually applied, and rebuilds itself when you change it.
- **Presence could not be turned back on without restarting.** The poll loop refuses to start while the setting is off, so an app that started with presence disabled had no timer — and flipping the switch did nothing until the next launch.
- **The Friends tab never picked an account.** Its picker was seeded while the account store was still empty (accounts are decrypted a moment later during startup), so it always landed on nothing and the tab stayed blank until you chose an account by hand.
- **The server browser lost your selection when you changed the sort mode**, after which Join answered "Select a server first".
- **Restored backups came back unusable.** The backup format never stored the user id, and nearly everything keys off it — presence, RAP, Premium, launch attribution. Backups now carry it, and a restore re-validates cookies to backfill it for files written by older versions.
- Refreshing account data spent one request per **dead** cookie on the Robux endpoint every time; invalid accounts are now skipped, as the economy pass already did.
- The debounced Place ID lookup leaked a `CancellationTokenSource` on every keystroke.

### Security

- The backup password minimum is **12 characters**, deliberately stricter than the master password on `accounts.dat`. That file keeps every cookie individually DPAPI-wrapped, so cracking its password still leaves the cookies bound to the original Windows user. A backup stores raw cookies by design — that is what makes it portable — so its password is the only thing between the file and full account takeover, and the file is meant to travel.
- API tokens are generated from a cryptographic RNG (192 bits). The control server stays bound to `127.0.0.1`, every route but `/ping` requires the token, and the settings page says plainly that anyone able to run code as you can read it.
- *Test proxy* deliberately sends no cookie, so pointing it at an untrusted proxy cannot leak a session.

### Under the hood

- `FFlagsService` gained per-launch application, tolerant raw-JSON parsing and validation
- `RobloxApi` builds its HTTP client lazily and rebuilds it when the proxy configuration changes
- Clean build: 0 warnings, 0 errors

---

## v1.4.0

### Multi-instance now works for launches started outside the app

This is the headline fix. Roblox enforces single-instance with **two** guards, and the app only ever defeated one of them:

| Guard | Where it lives | Before |
|---|---|---|
| `ROBLOX_singletonMutex` | global named mutex | held open ✅ |
| `ROBLOX_singletonEvent` | **inside each client process** | untouched ❌ |

Because of the second guard, pressing **Play** on roblox.com, launching from the Roblox home screen, or opening a Discord invite while a client was already running did *not* open a new window — the new client handed its launch URL to the running one and exited. Launches from the manager itself were unaffected, since those carry a fresh auth ticket the running client accepts, which is why the problem looked inconsistent.

The new guard clears that per-client lock in every running client and keeps doing so via a lightweight watcher, so a client the app never started is treated exactly like one it did.

### New

- **Multi-instance guard panel** (Settings → Launch) — live status, a *Fix multi-instance now* button, and a *Restart as administrator* option that appears only when elevation would actually help
- **External clients are managed too** — clients started from the website or home screen are adopted into the registry, so Anti-AFK, the RAM monitor and the window grid can reach them
- **Self-check** (Settings → Diagnostics) — verifies the Roblox install, the `roblox-player` protocol handler (and warns when another launcher has hijacked it), data-folder writability, free disk space, Roblox API reachability, and the multi-instance guard
- **Diagnostics log** — one rotating, cookie-scrubbed log with an in-app error counter, *Open log folder* and *Clear log*
- **Client window controls** — arrange every client in a grid, minimize all, restore all

### Fixes

- **Data loss:** an account file that failed to decrypt (typically copied from another Windows user or PC) silently loaded as *empty*, and the next save overwrote the real file **and its backup**. The app now refuses to start and tells you where the file is.
- **Wrong client attribution:** two accounts launched close together were deterministically swapped — the wrong cookie on auto-rejoin, and "close previous client" killing the other account's window
- **Untracked clients:** attribution was a single attempt 4 s after launch; a slow client start meant it was never tracked at all — no Anti-AFK, no crash watchdog, no RAM cap, and nothing said so. Now retried for 24 s.
- **PID reuse:** tracked PIDs were never re-validated, so a recycled PID could have the RAM monitor kill, Anti-AFK type into, or the scheduler close an unrelated application
- **Rate limiting:** an HTTP 429 (exactly what launching several accounts in a row provokes) was treated as "this cookie is dead" and marked good accounts invalid. Only 401/403 do that now.
- **Anti-AFK** no longer sends its keystroke when the client window fails to take focus — it used to type Space/W into whatever you were doing
- **Scheduler auto-close** now only closes the clients that task started, instead of every client of those accounts
- **Mutex thread affinity:** the multi-instance mutex was acquired on whichever thread ran a launch and released from another, which always threw and was silently swallowed. It now lives on its own thread.
- Crash reports **append** instead of truncating — a repeating fault no longer destroys the evidence of the first one

### Under the hood

- New services: `RobloxSingletonService`, `DiagnosticsService`, `HealthCheckService`, `InstanceControlService`
- Handle-level singleton clearing via the process handle table (`NtQueryInformationProcess` → `DuplicateHandle` with `DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE`), with a system-wide fallback for older Windows
- Failures the user can act on now surface as a toast or a status line instead of an empty `catch`
- Clean build: 0 warnings, 0 errors

### Note

Roblox's anti-tamper can refuse the process handle on some systems. If that happens the app says so explicitly and offers to restart with administrator rights — it no longer just quietly does nothing.

## v1.3.3

### New

- Smoother UI everywhere: animated page transitions plus soft hover/press fades on cards, buttons and list items
- Buttons polished: subtle scale/opacity feedback and animated icons (hover wiggle, press shrink)
- Presence detection is much faster: shorter poll cadence and an instant refresh right after account actions

### Fixes

- Card glow toned down: smaller reach, no more bleeding deep into card content
- "Update available" state now shows reliably after background update checks

### Under the hood

- Dropped the entire WinForms framework from the bundle — tray icon and global hotkeys now run on native Win32 (Shell_NotifyIcon / RegisterHotKey via HwndSource)
- Single-file exe shrunk from 63.2 MB to 55.9 MB with zero feature loss
- Clean build: 0 warnings, 0 errors
